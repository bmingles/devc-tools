# (test.sh) already asserts pi stays absent when the option is left at its default; this is the
# other half, and the only scenario that exercises install.sh's node prelude against a real
# container: pi installs itself with npm, and at build time node is on disk but not on a
# non-interactive shell's PATH.

# The prelude pins npm's global prefix to ~/.local precisely so this holds. Unpinned, npm under
# nvm resolves the prefix to the *active node version's* own directory, and pi would drop out of
# PATH the moment node-nvmrc switched the container onto a different version for a project's
# .nvmrc — and install.sh's `[ ! -x "$HOME/.local/bin/pi" ]` guard would re-download it every
# rebuild. This is the assertion that catches losing that pin.
