// The `devcontainer` CLI, embedded in devc — not looked up on PATH, and not run through
// `devc-core`'s default `nodeDevcontainerRunner` either: that runner spawns `process.execPath`
// against a `devcontainer.js` resolved from `node_modules`, and a `deno compile` binary has
// neither. This module is the CLI's own `DevcontainerRunner` (see `devc-core/devcontainer.ts`),
// bound into `container.ts` below.
//
// `@devcontainers/cli` ships **no programmatic API**: its `package.json` declares only `bin`, and
// its esbuild bundle ends in `0&&(module.exports={doExec})` — the dead-code marker, so it exports
// nothing. Importing it *runs* the CLI against `process.argv` and finishes with `process.exit()`.
// Both facts rule out calling it in-process: devc would have to hand over its own argv and would
// be killed when the CLI exits.
//
// So devc re-execs **itself** with a hidden `__devcontainer` subcommand
// ({@link DEVCONTAINER_SUBCOMMAND}). The child sets `process.argv` and imports the bundle, which
// makes that process a devcontainer CLI; the parent pipes its stdout exactly as it piped the PATH
// binary's, so {@link import("@devc-tools/core/container.ts").startContainer}'s JSON-per-line
// parsing is unchanged. One binary — neither `devcontainer` nor `node` has to exist on the host.
//
// The npm package is pinned in `deno.json`'s `imports` and embedded by `deno compile`, which is
// what makes the child self-sufficient. It is pure JavaScript with zero dependencies, so it
// cross-compiles to every release target like the rest of the graph.
